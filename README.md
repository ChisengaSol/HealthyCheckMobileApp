# Health check-up and food planner app

The app checks your health day by day and suggests you proper meals that you should consume in order to remain healthy. It connects you to the numerous healthy-recipes that are provided by professional chef-bloggers. You can set your content to be provided as per your health situation, for example, if you are a heart patient, youâ€™ll be recommended recipes made of ingredients that are heart-healthy. The app can partner with groceries to deliver healthy items online directly from the app.
